# Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Atmospheric.Bmp180

**BMP180 I2C barometric pressure, temperature, and altitude sensor**

The **Bmp180** library is included in the **Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Atmospheric.Bmp180** nuget package and is designed for the [Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) Meadow .NET IoT platform.

This driver is part of the [Meadow.Foundation](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/) peripherals library, an open-source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your C# .NET Meadow IoT applications.

For more information on developing for Meadow, visit [developer.wildernesslabs.co](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/).

## Installation

You can install the library from within Visual studio using the the NuGet Package Manager or from the command line using the .NET CLI:

`dotnet add package Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Atmospheric.Bmp180`
## Usage

```csharp
Bmp180 sensor;

public override Task Initialize()
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Initializing...");

    sensor = new Bmp180(Device.CreateI2cBus());

    var consumer = Bmp180.CreateObserver(
        handler: result =>
        {
            Resolver.Log.Info($"Observer: Temp changed by threshold; new temp: {result.New.Temperature?.Celsius:N2}C, old: {result.Old?.Temperature?.Celsius:N2}C");
        },
        filter: result =>
        {
            if (result.Old is { } old)
            {
                return (
                (result.New.Temperature.Value - old.Temperature.Value).Abs().Celsius > 0.5);
            }
            return false;
        }
    );
    sensor.Subscribe(consumer);

    sensor.Updated += (sender, result) =>
    {
        Resolver.Log.Info($"  Temperature: {result.New.Temperature?.Celsius:N2}C");
        Resolver.Log.Info($"  Pressure: {result.New.Pressure?.Bar:N2}bar");
    };

    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

public override async Task Run()
{
    var conditions = await sensor.Read();
    Resolver.Log.Info($"Temperature: {conditions.Temperature?.Celsius}Â°C, Pressure: {conditions.Pressure?.Pascal}Pa");

    sensor.StartUpdating(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
}

```
