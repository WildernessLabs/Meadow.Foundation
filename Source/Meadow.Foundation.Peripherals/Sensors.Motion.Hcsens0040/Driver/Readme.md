# Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Motion.Hcsens0040

**HCSENS0040 digital microwave motion sensor**

The **Hcsens0040** library is included in the **Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Motion.Hcsens0040** nuget package and is designed for the [Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) Meadow .NET IoT platform.

This driver is part of the [Meadow.Foundation](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/) peripherals library, an open-source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your C# .NET Meadow IoT applications.

For more information on developing for Meadow, visit [developer.wildernesslabs.co](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/).

## Installation

You can install the library from within Visual studio using the the NuGet Package Manager or from the command line using the .NET CLI:

`dotnet add package Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Motion.Hcsens0040`
## Usage

```csharp
private Hcsens0040 sensor;

public override Task Initialize()
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Initialize...");

    sensor = new Hcsens0040(Device.CreateDigitalInterruptPort(Device.Pins.D05, Meadow.Hardware.InterruptMode.EdgeBoth));
    sensor.OnMotionDetected += Sensor_OnMotionDetected;

    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

private void Sensor_OnMotionDetected(object sender)
{
    Resolver.Log.Info($"Motion detected {DateTime.Now}");
}

```
