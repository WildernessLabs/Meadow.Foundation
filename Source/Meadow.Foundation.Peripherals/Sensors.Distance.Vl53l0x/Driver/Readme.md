# Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Distance.Vl53l0x

**Vl53l0x I2C time of flight ranging distance sensor**

The **Vl53l0x** library is included in the **Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Distance.Vl53l0x** nuget package and is designed for the [Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) Meadow .NET IoT platform.

This driver is part of the [Meadow.Foundation](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/) peripherals library, an open-source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your C# .NET Meadow IoT applications.

For more information on developing for Meadow, visit [developer.wildernesslabs.co](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/).

## Installation

You can install the library from within Visual studio using the the NuGet Package Manager or from the command line using the .NET CLI:

`dotnet add package Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Distance.Vl53l0x`
## Usage

```csharp
Vl53l0x sensor;

public override Task Initialize()
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Initializing hardware...");

    var i2cBus = Device.CreateI2cBus(I2cBusSpeed.FastPlus);
    sensor = new Vl53l0x(i2cBus);

    sensor.Updated += Sensor_Updated;

    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

public override Task Run()
{
    sensor.StartUpdating(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(250));

    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

private void Sensor_Updated(object sender, IChangeResult<Length> result)
{
    if (result.New == null) { return; }

    if (result.New < new Length(0, LU.Millimeters))
    {
        Resolver.Log.Info("out of range.");
    }
    else
    {
        Resolver.Log.Info($"{result.New.Millimeters}mm / {result.New.Inches:n3}\"");
    }
}

```
