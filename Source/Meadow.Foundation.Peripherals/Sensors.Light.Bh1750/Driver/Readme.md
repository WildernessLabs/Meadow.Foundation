# Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Light.Bh1750

**Bh1750 I2C luminance and color light sensor**

The **Bh1750** library is included in the **Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Light.Bh1750** nuget package and is designed for the [Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) Meadow .NET IoT platform.

This driver is part of the [Meadow.Foundation](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/) peripherals library, an open-source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your C# .NET Meadow IoT applications.

For more information on developing for Meadow, visit [developer.wildernesslabs.co](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/).

## Installation

You can install the library from within Visual studio using the the NuGet Package Manager or from the command line using the .NET CLI:

`dotnet add package Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Light.Bh1750`
## Usage

```csharp
Bh1750 sensor;

public override Task Initialize()
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Initialize...");

    var i2c = Device.CreateI2cBus();
    sensor = new Bh1750(
        i2c,
        measuringMode: Mode.ContinuouslyHighResolutionMode, // the various modes take differing amounts of time.
        lightTransmittance: 1 // lower this to increase sensitivity, for instance, if it's behind a semi opaque window
        );

    // Example that uses an IObservable subscription to only be notified when the filter is satisfied
    var consumer = Bh1750.CreateObserver(
        handler: result => Resolver.Log.Info($"Observer: filter satisfied: {result.New.Lux:N2}Lux, old: {result.Old?.Lux:N2}Lux"),

        // only notify if the visible light changes by 100 lux (put your hand over the sensor to trigger)
        filter: result =>
        {
            if (result.Old is { } old)
            {
                // returns true if > 100lux change
                return ((result.New - old).Abs().Lux > 100);
            }
            return false;
        });
    sensor.Subscribe(consumer);

    // classical .NET events can also be used:
    sensor.Updated += (sender, result) => Resolver.Log.Info($"Light: {result.New.Lux:N2}Lux");

    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

public override async Task Run()
{
    var result = await sensor.Read();
    Resolver.Log.Info("Initial Readings:");
    Resolver.Log.Info($" Light: {result.Lux:N2}Lux");

    sensor.StartUpdating(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
}

```
