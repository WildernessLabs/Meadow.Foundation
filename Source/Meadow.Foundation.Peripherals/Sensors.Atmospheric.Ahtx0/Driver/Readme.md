# Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Atmospheric.Ahtx0

**AHTx0 I2C temperature and humidity sensors**

The **Ahtx0** library is included in the **Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Atmospheric.Ahtx0** nuget package and is designed for the [Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) Meadow .NET IoT platform.

This driver is part of the [Meadow.Foundation](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/) peripherals library, an open-source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your C# .NET Meadow IoT applications.

For more information on developing for Meadow, visit [developer.wildernesslabs.co](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/).

## Installation

You can install the library from within Visual studio using the the NuGet Package Manager or from the command line using the .NET CLI:

`dotnet add package Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Atmospheric.Ahtx0`
## Usage

```csharp
private Ahtx0 sensor;

public override Task Initialize()
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Initialize...");

    // adjust the index to match your hardware configuration
    var ft232 = FtdiExpanderCollection.Devices[0];

    sensor = new Aht10(ft232.CreateI2cBus());

    var consumer = Aht10.CreateObserver(
        handler: (result) =>
        {
            Resolver.Log.Info($"Observer: Temp changed by threshold; new temp: {result.New.Temperature?.Celsius:N2}C, old: {result.Old?.Temperature?.Celsius:N2}C");
        },
        filter: null
    );
    sensor.Subscribe(consumer);

    (sensor as ITemperatureSensor).Updated += (sender, e) =>
    {
        Resolver.Log.Info($"Temperature Updated: {e.New.Celsius:n2}C");
    };
    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

public override async Task Run()
{
    if (sensor == null) { return; }

    var result = await sensor.Read();
    Resolver.Log.Info("Initial Readings:");
    Resolver.Log.Info($"  Temperature: {result.Temperature?.Celsius:F1}Â°C");
    Resolver.Log.Info($"  Relative Humidity: {result.Humidity:F1}%");

    sensor.StartUpdating(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
}

```
