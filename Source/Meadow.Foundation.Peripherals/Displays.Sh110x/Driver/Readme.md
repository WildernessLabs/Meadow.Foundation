# Meadow.Foundation.Displays.Sh110x

**S1106 and SH1107 SPI and I2C monochrome OLED displays**

The **Sh110x** library is included in the **Meadow.Foundation.Displays.Sh110x** nuget package and is designed for the [Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) Meadow .NET IoT platform.

This driver is part of the [Meadow.Foundation](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/) peripherals library, an open-source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your C# .NET Meadow IoT applications.

## Installation

You can install the library from within Visual studio using the the NuGet Package Manager or from the command line using the .NET CLI:

`dotnet add package Meadow.Foundation.Displays.Sh110x`
## Usage

```csharp
MicroGraphics graphics;

public override Task Initialize()
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Initializing...");

    var sh1106 = new Sh1106
    (
        spiBus: Device.CreateSpiBus(),
        chipSelectPin: Device.Pins.D02,
        dcPin: Device.Pins.D01,
        resetPin: Device.Pins.D00
    );

    graphics = new MicroGraphics(sh1106);
    graphics.CurrentFont = new Font8x8();
    graphics.Rotation = RotationType._180Degrees;

    return base.Initialize();
}

public override Task Run()
{
    graphics.Clear();
    graphics.DrawRectangle(0, 0, 128, 64, false);
    graphics.DrawTriangle(10, 10, 50, 50, 10, 50, false);
    graphics.DrawRectangle(20, 15, 40, 20, true);
    graphics.DrawText(5, 5, "SH1106");
    graphics.Show();

    return base.Run();
}
