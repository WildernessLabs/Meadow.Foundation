# Meadow.Foundation.ICs.IOExpanders.Pca9685

**PCA9685 I2C PWM expander**

The **Pca9685** library is included in the **Meadow.Foundation.ICs.IOExpanders.Pca9685** nuget package and is designed for the [Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) Meadow .NET IoT platform.

This driver is part of the [Meadow.Foundation](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/) peripherals library, an open-source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your C# .NET Meadow IoT applications.

## Installation

You can install the library from within Visual studio using the the NuGet Package Manager or from the command line using the .NET CLI:

`dotnet add package Meadow.Foundation.ICs.IOExpanders.Pca9685`
## Usage

```csharp
private Pca9685 pca9685;

public override Task Initialize()
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Initialize...");
    var i2CBus = Device.CreateI2cBus(I2cBusSpeed.FastPlus);

    pca9685 = new Pca9685(i2CBus, new Meadow.Units.Frequency(50, Meadow.Units.Frequency.UnitType.Hertz), (byte)Pca9685.Addresses.Default);

    return base.Initialize();
}

public override Task Run()
{
    var port0 = pca9685.CreatePwmPort(pca9685.Pins.LED0, 0.05f);
    var port7 = pca9685.CreatePwmPort(pca9685.Pins.LED7);

    port0.Start();
    port7.Start();

    return base.Run();
}

```
