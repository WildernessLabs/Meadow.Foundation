# Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Temperature.Mcp9808

**MCP9808 I2C temperature sensor**

The **Mcp9808** library is included in the **Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Temperature.Mcp9808** nuget package and is designed for the [Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) Meadow .NET IoT platform.

This driver is part of the [Meadow.Foundation](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/) peripherals library, an open-source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your C# .NET Meadow IoT applications.

For more information on developing for Meadow, visit [developer.wildernesslabs.co](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/).

## Installation

You can install the library from within Visual studio using the the NuGet Package Manager or from the command line using the .NET CLI:

`dotnet add package Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Temperature.Mcp9808`
## Usage

```csharp
Mcp9808 mcp9808;

public override Task Initialize()
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Initialize...");

    mcp9808 = new Mcp9808(Device.CreateI2cBus());

    var consumer = Mcp9808.CreateObserver(
        handler: result =>
        {
            Resolver.Log.Info($"Temperature New Value {result.New.Celsius}C");
            Resolver.Log.Info($"Temperature Old Value {result.Old?.Celsius}C");
        },
        filter: null
    );
    mcp9808.Subscribe(consumer);

    mcp9808.Updated += (object sender, IChangeResult<Meadow.Units.Temperature> e) =>
    {
        Resolver.Log.Info($"Temperature Updated: {e.New.Celsius:N2}C");
    };

    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

public override async Task Run()
{
    var temp = await mcp9808.Read();

    Resolver.Log.Info($"Temperature New Value {temp.Celsius}C");

    mcp9808.StartUpdating(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
}

```
