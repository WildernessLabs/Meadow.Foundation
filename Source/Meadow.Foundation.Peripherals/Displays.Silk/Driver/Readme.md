# Meadow.Foundation.Displays.Silk

**Display driver for Meadow using Silk.NET and SkiaSharp**

The **Meadow.Silk** library is included in the **Meadow.Foundation.Displays.Silk** nuget package and is designed for the [Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) Meadow .NET IoT platform.

This driver is part of the [Meadow.Foundation](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/) peripherals library, an open-source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your C# .NET Meadow IoT applications.

For more information on developing for Meadow, visit [developer.wildernesslabs.co](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/).

## Installation

You can install the library from within Visual studio using the the NuGet Package Manager or from the command line using the .NET CLI:

`dotnet add package Meadow.Foundation.Displays.Silk`
## Usage

```csharp
public class Program 
{
static SilkDisplay? display;
static MicroGraphics graphics = default!;

public static void Main()
{
    Initialize();
    Run();

    Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
}

public static void Initialize()
{
    display = new SilkDisplay(640, 480, displayScale: 1f);

    graphics = new MicroGraphics(display)
    {
        CurrentFont = new Font16x24(),
        Stroke = 1
    };
}

public static void Run()
{
    graphics.Clear();

    graphics.DrawText(10, 10, "Silk.NET", Color.White);

    graphics.DrawText(10, 40, "1234567890!@#$%^&*(){}[],./<>?;':", Color.LawnGreen);
    graphics.DrawText(10, 70, "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", Color.Cyan);
    graphics.DrawText(10, 100, "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", Color.Yellow);
    graphics.DrawText(10, 130, "Temp: 21.5Â°C", Color.Orange);

    graphics.DrawTriangle(10, 220, 50, 260, 10, 260, Color.Red);
    graphics.DrawRectangle(20, 185, 80, 40, Color.Yellow, false);
    graphics.DrawCircle(50, 240, 40, Color.Blue, false);

    graphics.Show();

    display!.Run();
}
}
```
