# Meadow.Foundation

The [Meadow.Foundation](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/Peripherals/) peripherals library is an open source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your .NET Meadow IoT application.

Meadow.Foundation makes the task of building connected things easy with Meadow by providing a unified driver and library framework that includes drivers and abstractions for common peripherals such as: sensors, displays, motors, cameras and more. Additionally, it includes utility functions and helpers for common tasks when building connected things.

## Repositories 

Meadow.Foundation is currently split into multiple GitHub repos:
1. [Meadow.Foundation](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Foundation/) which contains the majority of the peripheral and library source code
2. [Meadow.Foundation.CompositeDevices]([https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Foundation.Featherwings/](https://github.com/wildernesslabs/meadow.foundation.compositedevices)) contains drivers for devices that combine multiple peripherals or leverage additional onboard microcontrollers
3. [Meadow.Foundation.Featherwings](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Foundation.Featherwings/) contains drivers for hardware that conforms to the [Adafruit Featherwing](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/) form factor
4. [Meadow.Foundation.Grove](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Foundation.Grove/) contains drivers for [Seeed Studio Grove](https://www.seeedstudio.com/grove.html) modular hardware peripherals
5. [Meadow.Foundation.MBus](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Foundation.MBus/) contains drivers for M-Bus peripherals
6. [Meadow.Foundation.MikroBus](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Foundation.mikrobus/) contains drivers for [MikroElektronika](https://www.mikroe.com/click)  mikroBUS Click Boards

## Repository Branches

Today, Meadow.Foundation is represented within two branches: `main` and `develop`.

### Main

The `main` branch represents the currently published code from the last official release. Meadow.Foundation projects that depend on other projects within Meadow.Foundation will have local project references. For example, display drivers will contain a project reference to MicroGraphics. Any references outside of Meadow.Foundation rely on the latest published nuget packages. Nuget references are typically only present in the Meadow.Foundation sample projects.

The `main` branch will compile without the need to clone additional projects. This branch is ideally used to review driver structure and run driver samples with the latest published and stable code.

### Develop

The `develop` branch represents the current state of development for the next official release. Code in this branch should be tested and functional. However, changes in this branch may depend on changes in other Meadow projects, such as Meadow Core. 

To compile the `develop` branch, you'll need to clone other dependency GitHub repositories at the same folder level as Meadow.Foundation. This includes but is not limited to: Meadow.Core, Meadow.Units, Meadow.Contracts, Meadow.Logging, and Meadow.Modbus. You can review the references in the `_external` solution folder within Meadow.Foundation for the complete list. Typically, all dependency projects should also be on the `develop` branch. This branch is ideal if you want to submit new drivers or propose substantial changes to existing code.

### Branch history

All code changes are committed to the `develop` branch. At the time of release, the references within develop are updated for publishing and then merged to `main`. This ensures a consistent and accurate history across `develop` and `main`. This also allows pull requests targeted to `main` to be easily retargeted to `develop`.

## Requesting New Drivers

If you have a need for a driver that we don't yet support, you have a couple options:

- Use an existing, similar driver as a template for your new driver.  We accept pull requests, but don't require them.
- Open a new item on the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Foundation/issues) and request the driver so we can prioritize it.

## Documentation

You can read more Meadow.Foundation and how to get started in our [developer site](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/).

## Using Meadow.Foundation

To use Meadow.Foundation, simply add a Nuget reference to the core library (for core helpers and drivers), or to the specific peripheral driver you'd like to use, and the core will come with it.

```bash
nuget install Meadow.Foundation
```

## Contributing

Meadow.Foundation, is open source and community powered. We love pull requests, so if you've got a driver to add, send it on over! For each peripheral driver, please include:

 * **Documentation** - Including a Fritzing breadboard schematic on wiring it up, sourcing info, and API docs. Please see other drivers for examples. Documentation is hosted on the Wilderness Labs [DocFx](https://wildernesslabs.github.io/docfx/) site.
 * **Datasheet** - For the peripheral, if applicable.
 * **Sample** - Application illustrating usage of the peripheral.
